      <p>My name is Thomas, I’m a sophmore studying at Carnegie Mellon University. I’m currently pursuing a Bachelor’s in CS, a minor in Game Design, and a Concentration in Computer Graphics. I like to mess with game and graphics engines in my free time. I made this site so that other people would believe me when I told them that, and to motivate myself to bring projects to completion. On here you’ll find basically anything I experimented with and found interesting.</p>

<p>In particular I enjoy making things in VR, things that explode and interesting puzzles. In broader terms I like to find new ways to allow players to become a part of and contribute to the worlds they play in.</p>
