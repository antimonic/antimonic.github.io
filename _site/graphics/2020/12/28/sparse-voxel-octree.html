    <h1 id="a-voxel-engine">A Voxel Engine</h1>

<p>Allowing players direct control over the geometry of the world space is the ultimate goal of a sandbox game. Voxels provide an expensive but complete
solution by dividing up 3D space into discrete units and allowing the players to manipulate and interact with each unit. Minecraft is the greatest
implementation as of yet of a complete Voxel world, but the low spatial resolution (1 block \(\approx\) 1 cubic meter) and simple lighting and physics systems restricts
the gameplay potential of the engine.</p>

<p>This series will follow my attempt to build a voxel game engine in C++ using OpenGL which can do the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Operate at a much higher spatial resolution than Minecraft</li>
  <li>Allow physics entities which can interact with the voxel environment without being locked to the voxel grid</li>
  <li>Allow realtime lighting and shadows</li>
  <li>Allow multiplayer</li>
  <li>Allow arbitrary-size worlds with a reasonable memory footprint</li>
</ul>

<p>Obviously I donâ€™t really expect to fulfill all of these goals but I think it will be more fun to aim for everything and look for a system which provides an
elegant general solution.</p>

<p>Almost everything in this article is derived from <a href="https://research.nvidia.com/sites/default/files/pubs/2010-02_Efficient-Sparse-Voxel/laine2010tr1_paper.pdf">this NVidia paper</a>.</p>

<h1 id="octrees">Octrees</h1>

<p>Octrees are a common data structure which allows us to recursively divide 3D space.
We can think of our world space as a root node with 8 children, who themselves have 8 children, and so on as needed.
Its easiest to show visually:</p>

<p>The simplest way to represent 3D space with an octree is to build a full octree down to the spatial resolution we need. The depth of the tree is the 8th root of the number of voxels we want to represent. For a world with only 8 voxels, we need only a single layer octree, a single root with 8 octant children. Once we have a full tree, we can attach a single bit to each node which represents the state of the voxel. This alone would allow us to approximate arbitrary geometry.</p>
