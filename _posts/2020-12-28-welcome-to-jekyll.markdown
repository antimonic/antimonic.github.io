Hello. This is the first post, mainly to test the blog architecture. 

This is all powered with a Ruby framework called [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). 

Below is a random code snippet to demonstrate syntax highlighting and code font.

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
